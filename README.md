## Horiseon Social Solution Services

# Description

Horiseon Social Solution Services is a website that focuses on Online Marketing and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) which helps customers build their online reputation.

I have been given the HTML structure and CSS styling, however, the provided code is not meeting the accessibility standards.

Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as older people, people in rural areas, and people in developing countries. Accessibility also benefits people without disabilities.

# Challenges

The challenge I've faced here was to update the code using semantic tags and keep the website layout as provided. Eliminating the <div> tags and adding the semantic tags, changing and combining classes for easy understanding, and adding meaningful comments on the code.

Definitely attention to detail was a big role in this challenge because there were missing IDs, alt="" elements added in divs, and a lot of classes with the same styling. Getting the above-mentioned changes I was able to minimize both HTML and CSS codes and create a better understanding of the code.

Here is the live URL:
The same layout has been kept and the code has been updated to accessibility standards. Preview the website below: https://github.com/alinatca/horiseon/blob/f7b91905cfeb79d84d43b3b52c5439242aeab09c/website-layout.png

# Things I learned

Getting this challenge done, I've become more organised in writing the code and by refactoring the given codes I have managed to find mistakes and unuseful code lines which can be eliminated for a better understanding of the code.
